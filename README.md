# Statistics for Humans

## Install

From PyPi

```
pip install verysimplestats
```

From GitHub (with pip)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PierreSelim/verysimplestats.git
```

## Purity
This library tries to be as pure as possible, it means we do not return value
when the computation cannot be performed; we prefer raising `ValueError` when
input data are not correct.

## Tests
The doctest can be launched with

```
nosetests --with-doctest --with-coverage --cover-package=verysimplestats
```

## Examples

Mean value

```python
>>> import verysimplestats as stats
>>> stats.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
3.0
```

Median value

```python
>>> import verysimplestats as stats
>>> stats.median([5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3])
3.5
```

Linear regression

```python
>>> import verysimplestats as stats
>>> lm = stats.linear_regression([1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 4.5])
>>> lm
LinearRegression([1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 4.5])
>>> (lm.slope, lm.intercept, lm.rsquared)
(1.7499999999999984, -0.6666666666666634, 0.9932432432432422)
>>> [round(e, 4) for e in lm.residuals]
[-0.0833, 0.1667, -0.0833]
```

Variance is computed only for list of length greater or equal to 2

```python
>>> import verysimplestats as stats
>>> stats.variance([1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "verysimplestats\statistics.py", line 79, in variance
    raise ValueError(msg.format(x=x))
ValueError: Variance only exists for list with at least 2 elements [1]
```
